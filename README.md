    - http://installrails.com/ & 
    - http://railsinstaller.org/en are both great resources.
* Make sure you install Rails version 4.x. 
* Open terminal/command prompt and run the following commands:
    - `ruby --version` (expected: version 2.x+)
    - `rails --version` (expected: version 4.x+)
* Official Requirements:
    * Rails 5 requires Ruby 2.2.2 or newer.
    * Rails 4 prefers Ruby 2.0 and requires 1.9.3 or newer.

## Learning Objectives :heavy_check_mark:

We are going to be building a Ruby on Rails application that allows users to save positive notes that everyone can see and share. 
The goal of this workshop is to walk away with the following:

- An understanding of the Ruby on Rails ecosystem
- Knowledge of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern
- Ability to identify common components in the Rails ecosystem
- Describe how to use Rake to manipulate database and model creation
- Generate controllers that allow users serve content
- Manipulate Views to create a user experience layer
- Understand basic HTTP routes and how they map to controllers

If any of these objectives do not make sense, do not fear! We will be introducing them throughout the workshop.

###### Intended Audience :book:

This workshop is aimed at those who are familiar with programming to some degree. You do _not_ need Ruby experience. However, you will need to be comfortable with the command line of your operating system (`command.exe` or `Bash` or whatever you use). The more familiarity with Ruby (or any object-oriented language), the better. Developers that use another MVC framework (such as Laravel, ASP.NET, Spring) will feel at home here.

###### Help! and Self-troubleshooting :raising_hand: 

If you run into a problem we will do our best to assist you throughout this workshop. However, due to issues out of our control, we may not be able to accommodate everyone. Older computers and Windows machines historically have run into issues in the past. If we are unable to assist you, do not fret - we can point you in the right direction after the workshop for help.

###### Pre-Workshop Troubleshooting :scream_cat:

If you run into any issues prior to the workshop, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/code-for-coffee/anitaborg-rails-workshop/issues/new) on Github (requires account registration) and copy/paste as much data as you can. Please also list your operating system, type of machine, and which guide(s) you followed to install Rails.
